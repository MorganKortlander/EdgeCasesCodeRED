# EdgeCasesCodeRED
The Edge Cases CodeRED Genesis 2024 submission.
For our submission, we took the ConocoPhilips track to create an application that would track/monitor sustainability by geographical locations that is managed/run by ConocoPhillips.

We would like to...
    1. have an interactive GUI for displaying data
    2. display CP locations on the map as pins (diff colors for headquarters)
    3. focus efforts on areas where CP has locations
    4. show some form of data analysis w/ regression or another simple statistical learning technique




We want to do this by...
    Have a gui on Jupyter notebook to do some predefined tasks with the datasets loaded in (don't bother with API calls unless time permits)
        export the results and display with html or similar (JS is too much of an ask for current knowledge set, probably)


So, I'm thinking we make a graphic of CP locations, maybe relative share of CP's production in the thousand barrels oil equivalent (so, percentages), then relate it to some measure

Have fact sheets for USA: 
    make graph showing production by year 2018-2022
        show total for USA, total for each of the 3 areas of interest, then % each area of interest contributed (note the presence of other sites, but they are not significant)
        mouse over points on graph to show years? Nah, just have on the bottom
    compare the CP GHG outputs for the USA as a whole from sustainability reports (and other stuff?) compared to the whole of the CP performance reported in sustainability?
    *Also try to link to energy demand/usage, and per capita usage
